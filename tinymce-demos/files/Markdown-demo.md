# The Marvelous World of Markdown with TinyMCE

Welcome to our quick tour through the features of Markdown using the TinyMCE Markdown Plugin! Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using plain text formatting syntax. It's designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool like TinyMCE. Let's dive in!
